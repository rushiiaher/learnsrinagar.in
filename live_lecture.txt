Feature Concept: Live Classes Integration in School Management System
 Overview

The Live Classes feature allows authorized users (Super Admin, School Admin, Class Teachers, and Subject Teachers) to schedule or share YouTube Live Lecture Links directly within the school management system.
Students can then view these live lectures seamlessly inside the student portal, without leaving the platform.

 Objective

When students log in to their portal:

They navigate to “Live Classes” in their dashboard.
